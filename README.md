# Hello, I'm Dimas 

I'm a software engineering student at the University of Alberta and a current software developer intern at [NOV](https://www.nov.com/).

I love arguing about real-world problems and (sometimes) building something to solve them. I'm currently interested in web development and machine learning. Check out my projects below.
